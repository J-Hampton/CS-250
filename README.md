1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories help to layout the user needs in a format that is easy to read and understand. A user story also helps to break down the user request into the components needed for development so that it is easily understood. The user story can also help to identify missing information in a request so that clarification can be made if necessary.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs in the future I intend to incorporate the iterative design of agile processes as well as the planning involved with agile. User stories and product backlogs help to break a project down into more easily digestible pieces. The iterative process helps a developer to focus on one task or program component and complete that component before moving on to the next.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development is reliable, available, and involved. In terms of being reliable a software developer should complete the tasks they are assigned to their best ability in the set time frame, should be available to help others when needed, be able to clarify any code they have written, and be involved with the team, willing to help out and answer questions as necessary.
